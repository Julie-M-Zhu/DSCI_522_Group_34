Contributors: Kangbo Lu, Siqi Zhou, Mitchie Zhao, Mengyuan Zhu

Milestone 1 of group 34 of a data analysis project for DSCI 522 (Data Science workflows); a
course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of
British Columbia.

## About

Description of the dataset: 

This data set provides information on the location of sites with graffiti as identified by City staff. 

Data currency: 

This data in City systems is updated in the normal course of business, however priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected in the database. The extract on this web site is updated weekly.

Data accuracy: 

Locations are identified by address and therefore locations are approximate.

Research question:

Is the number of graffiti per location of the Vancouver's downtown area differs from the number of graffiti per location of the Vancouver Strathcona area?

We can do EDA and conduct Hypothesis testing with a suitable test flavor:

Does the median/mean number of graffiti per location of Vancouver's downtown area differ from the median/mean number of graffiti per location of Vancouver's Strathcona area?

We can use the "count" and "geo local area" columns to do permutation for hypothesis testing.
